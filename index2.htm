<h1>Hello World - index2.htm</h1>
<p>
This is an <b>HTML</b> page.  
</p>
<pre> 
It seems to have some PHP in it but since it has 
a ".htm" suffix the web server simply sends it to 
your browser.  

<?php
 echo("Hello world");
?>

Hint: View Source or use the Developer console:)
</pre>
<p>Next: <a href="index2.php">index2.php</a></p>
</body>
