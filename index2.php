<h1>Hello World - index2.php</h1>
<p>
This is a <a href="http://www.wa4e.com">PHP</a> 
page. Most of it is just HTML.
</p>
<p> 
But in a PHP file, we can switch into PHP by
enclosing PHP code between &lt;?php and ?>.
As the server reads the file, when it
sees PHP code, it executes it and 
the output of that code is returned to 
your browser in place of the &lt;?php ... ?>
</p>
<pre>
PHP has a "print" statement like many languages.

<?php
 print "Hello world";
?>

Back in HTML - lets go into PHP one more time.

<?php
 print "Today is:". date("Y-m-d H:i:s");
?>

All done...
</pre>
<p>Next: <a href="index3.php">index3.php</a></p>
</body>
</html>
